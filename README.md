# üßæ Introduction

In this paper, we study the problem of TSC with missing data in the offline setting. We introduce **DiffLight**, a novel conditional diffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting. Specifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, <em>i.e.</em>, traffic data imputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the learning process. Meanwhile, we propose a Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under data-missing scenarios. In addition,  to effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) architecture.

Extensive experiments on five datasets with various data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data.

# üõ†Ô∏è Usage

## Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Install CityFlow by following the instructions [here](https://cityflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Data Preparation

1. Download the memories of datasets from the following links:
    - [Hangzhou<sub>1</sub>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wu8gkoy_lCrAci6D4lFIEX8SNIekVfye/view?usp=drive_link) (HZ<sub>1</sub>)
    - [Hangzhou<sub>2</sub>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BIu94hSC2jYOSqOnmJgwdXyoCXuEl1Cj/view?usp=drive_link) (HZ<sub>2</sub>)
    - [Jinan<sub>1</sub>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LPeqLpSBr2-tRjsrHc-Tx_Qan92bJgkp/view?usp=drive_link) (JN<sub>1</sub>)
    - [Jinan<sub>2</sub>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FD1ROf87xxAK9PjxEwVH176d4VJJBmQX/view?usp=drive_link) (JN<sub>2</sub>)
    - [Jinan<sub>3</sub>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_EE4nmb7okh338eCo-cmxeiNqUxGgYYW/view?usp=drive_link) (JN<sub>3</sub>)
2. Place the downloaded memories in the `memory/fourphase/` directory.
3. Unzip the memories using the following command:
    ```sh
    unzip memory/fourphase/[dataset].zip -d memory/fourphase/
    ```

## Running DiffLight

1. Run the DiffLight algorithm using the following command:
    ```sh
    python run_difflight.py -[dataset] -[pattern & rate]
    ```
    where `[dataset]` is the city name (e.g., `hangzhou_1`, `jinan_1`, `newyork`) and `[pattern & rate]` is the data-missing scenario (e.g., `rm_1`: random missing, `km_wn_1`: kriging missing w/ neighbors, `km_won_1`: kriging missing wo/ neighbors).
    
## Evaluating Results

1. After running the experiments, you can summarize and evaluate the results using:
    ```sh
    python summary.py
    ```

## Example Configuration

Here is an example for running the DiffLight algorithm on the Hangzhou dataset with random missing data:
```sh
python run_difflight.py -hangzhou_1 -rm_1
```
